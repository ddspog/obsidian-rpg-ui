# System Architecture

The RPG UI Toolkit uses a flexible system abstraction layer that allows multiple RPG systems (D&D 5e, Fate, etc.) to be supported with their own rules and mechanics.

## Overview

A **system** defines:
- Core attributes (e.g., Strength, Dexterity for D&D 5e)
- Skills and their attribute associations
- Mathematical expressions for calculations
- Feature types and their display order
- Entity types (character, class, race, monster, etc.)
- Provider/Collector relationships for features

## Feature Provider/Collector Pattern

The system uses a provider/collector pattern to manage features across different entity types:

### Feature Collectors

**Collectors** are entity types that **receive and display** features from other files. Examples:
- `character` - Player characters
- `monster` - NPCs and creatures

A character note automatically collects features from:
- Their class (based on frontmatter `class` field)
- Their race (based on frontmatter `race` field)
- Direct features defined in the character's own `rpg features` block

### Feature Providers

**Providers** are entity types that **define features to pass on** to collectors. Examples:
- `class` - D&D classes (Fighter, Wizard, etc.)
- `race` - D&D races (Human, Elf, etc.)

A class note defines features that characters of that class will receive, often with level requirements.

### Example Flow

```
Fighter.md (class provider)
├─ rpg features
│  └─ Second Wind (level 1, type: bonus_action)
│  └─ Action Surge (level 2, type: active)
│  └─ Extra Attack (level 5, type: passive)

Human.md (race provider)
├─ rpg features
│  └─ Extra Language (no level requirement)
│  └─ Versatile (+1 to all abilities)

Conan.md (character collector)
├─ frontmatter: class: Fighter, race: Human, level: 5
└─ Displays all features:
   - Second Wind (from Fighter)
   - Action Surge (from Fighter)
   - Extra Attack (from Fighter)
   - Extra Language (from Human)
   - Versatile (from Human)
```

## System Definition

In the system configuration (`lib/systems/dnd5e.ts` for D&D 5e), you define:

### Feature System Configuration

The `features` object in the system defines the complete feature system:

```typescript
features: {
  categories: [
    { id: "action", label: "Action", icon: "⚔️" },
    { id: "bonus_action", label: "Bonus Action", icon: "⚡" },
    { id: "reaction", label: "Reaction", icon: "🛡️" },
    { id: "passive", label: "Passive", icon: "👁️" },
    { id: "active", label: "Active", icon: "✨" },
  ],
  providers: ["class", "race"],
  collectors: ["character", "monster"],
}
```

**The order in the `categories` array determines the display order** when features are grouped by type.

The `providers` and `collectors` arrays define which entity types participate in the feature inheritance system.

### Entity Type Roles

Each entity type in `types` can have a `role` field:

```typescript
types: {
  character: {
    role: "collector",
    fields: [ /* frontmatter fields */ ]
  },
  class: {
    role: "provider",
    fields: [ /* frontmatter fields */ ]
  },
  race: {
    role: "provider",
    fields: [ /* frontmatter fields */ ]
  }
}
```

## Phase 2 vs Phase 3

**Phase 2 (Current):**
- System defined in code (`lib/systems/dnd5e.ts`)
- D&D 5e is the only built-in system
- All files use D&D 5e system

**Phase 3 (Future):**
- Systems defined in markdown files using `rpg system` blocks
- Multiple systems can coexist
- Folder-based system assignment
- Custom systems without code changes

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Features are defined where they logically belong (class notes, race notes)
2. **Reusability**: Multiple characters can reference the same class/race notes
3. **Maintainability**: Update a class feature once, all characters of that class see the change
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new provider types (backgrounds, feats, magic items)
5. **Flexibility**: Works with any RPG system, not just D&D 5e
