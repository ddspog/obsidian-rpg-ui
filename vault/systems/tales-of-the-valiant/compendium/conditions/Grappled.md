- A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed. 
- The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the incapacitated condition). 
- The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.
