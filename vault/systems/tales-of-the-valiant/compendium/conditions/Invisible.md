- An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. A creature with the invisible condition can always attempt to hide (see **Stealth** in **Chapter 6**) and has advantage on DEX (Stealth) checks to do so. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves. 
- Attack rolls against an invisible creature have disadvantage, and an invisible creature’s attack rolls have advantage.
