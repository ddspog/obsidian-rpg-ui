- A prone creature's only movement options are to crawl or to stand up. Standing up costs an amount of movement equal to half the creature's speed and ends the condition. 
- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. 
- An attack roll against a prone creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.
