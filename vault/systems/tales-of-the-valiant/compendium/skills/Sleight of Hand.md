An act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting an item on someone else or concealing an object on your person, calls for a DEX (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a DEX (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.
