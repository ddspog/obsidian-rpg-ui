A WIS (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize an unconscious companion at 0 HP or diagnose an illness. 
###### Stabilize 
Stabilizing a creature is a unique way that a PC can use the Medicine skill. When a PC is reduced to 0 HP during encounter gameplay, you can make a Medicine check to try to stabilize the fallen character so that they stop having to make death saves and risk death (see **Stabilizing a Creature** under **Death Saves** in this chapter).
