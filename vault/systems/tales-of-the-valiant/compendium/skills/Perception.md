Your WIS (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of surroundings and keenness of senses. For example, you might try to overhear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or catch the scent of monsters skulking through the forest. You might also try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, such as orcs lying in ambush, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door. 
###### Passive Perception 
Passive Perception is a unique way that a PC can use the Perception skill. Calculating passive Perception works the same as calculating any passive check (see **Passive Checks** in this chapter). Passive Perception gives you a chance to spot hidden threats, such as ambushes, even when you aren’t looking for them and lets you discover hazards or traps before you trigger them.
