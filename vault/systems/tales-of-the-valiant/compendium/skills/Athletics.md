Your STR (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include scaling a rain-slicked cliff, avoiding hazards on a climb, jumping unusually far, pulling off a stunt while jumping, swimming in treacherous currents, or staying afloat when a creature tries to pull you underwater. 
###### Grappling and Shoving 
Grappling and shoving are unique ways that a PC can use the Athletics skill. See the **Special Melee Attacks** section in this chapter for more detail.
