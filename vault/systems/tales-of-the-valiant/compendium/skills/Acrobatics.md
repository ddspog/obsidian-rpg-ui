Your DEX (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as running across a sheet of ice, balancing on a tightrope, or staying upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The GM might also call for a DEX (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips. 
###### Avoid or Escape a Grapple 
Escaping a grapple is a unique way that a PC can use the Acrobatics skill. When a creature attempts to grapple you in combat, you can use the Acrobatics skill to attempt to avoid or escape it. See the **Special Melee Attacks** section in this chapter for more detail.
