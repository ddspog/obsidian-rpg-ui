An attempt to influence someone through threats, hostility, and physical violence requires a CHA (Intimidation) check. Examples include prying information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down, or using a broken bottle to suggest that a sneering vizier reconsider.

>[!rules] ABILITY MODIFIERS AND ASSOCIATED SKILLS
> A skill is usually paired with a specific ability. That’s why a certain ability appears in parentheses after each skill on the character sheet. For example, the Athletics skill is almost always used to modify STR ability checks, so it’s listed as “Athletics (STR)” on the character sheet.

>However, some situations might call for a different approach, and the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill. You might also want to ask to use a different combination if it seems appropriate. 
>
>For example, if you have to swim to an island, the GM might call for a CON (Athletics) check to see if you have the stamina to make it there. If your character is proficient in Athletics, you would add your PB to the CON check instead of the normal STR (Athletics) check. Similarly, if your barbarian smashes a table to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a STR (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with CHA.
