Make a DEX (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone. 
###### Hiding 
Hiding is a unique way that a PC can use the Stealth skill. It’s tied to taking the Hide action in combat encounters (see **Actions in Combat** in this chapter). Any character can attempt to hide, even if they don’t have proficiency in the Stealth skill. 

The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you attempt to hide, make a DEX (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or stop hiding, that check result is contested by the Perception score of a creature that might discover you. 

You can’t attempt to hide from a creature that can sense you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. 

A creature with the invisible condition (see **Appendix A: Conditions**) can always attempt to hide and has advantage on DEX (Stealth) checks to do so. 

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it typically detects you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a distracted creature, granting you advantage on an attack roll (see **Unseen Attackers and Targets** under **Making an Attack** in this chapter). 

**_Perception Score._** In a monster or NPC stat block, each creature has a Perception score. Whether a monster is actively searching for you or just going about their business, the GM compares your DEX (Stealth) check result to the creature’s Perception score to see whether they notice you.
