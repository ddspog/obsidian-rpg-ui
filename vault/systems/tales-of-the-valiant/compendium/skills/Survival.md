The GM might ask you to make a WIS (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards. 
###### Tracking 
Tracking is a unique way that a PC can use the Survival skill. It involves detecting and following signs of a creature’s passage through an area. Any character can attempt to track, even if they don’t have proficiency in the Survival skill. 

A PC who wants to track a creature declares their intention to do so. Then the GM determines whether tracking is possible. For example, a GM could rule it is impossible to track a creature that moved through an area weeks ago because too much time has passed. 

If a GM determines tracking is possible, they decide whether a check is necessary. For example, clear signs of passage, such as muddy footprints on a wooden floor, might mean tracking automatically succeeds. 

If a GM determines a check is necessary, the tracking PC must succeed on a WIS (Survival) check. The DC for this check is set by the GM.
