Looking around for clues and making deductions based on those clues involves an INT (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls for a fragment of hidden knowledge might also call for an INT (Investigation) check.
