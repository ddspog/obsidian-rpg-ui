/* DEPRECATED: This file has been split into focused modules
 *
 * This file is no longer maintained. All session log styles have been
 * reorganized into the following modules for better maintainability:
 *
 *   - session-log-scene.css   (Scene headers and variants)
 *   - session-log-events.css  (Event cards with type-specific styling)
 *   - session-log-tags.css    (Tag pills with color variants)
 *   - session-log-hud.css     (HUD: entity selector, quick actions, summary)
 *   - session-log-overview.css (Session change overview display)
 *
 * These modules are imported in lib/styles/index.css.
 * Do NOT import this file directly; use the modular imports instead.
