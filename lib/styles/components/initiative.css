/* DEPRECATED: This file has been split into focused modules
 * 
 * This file is no longer maintained. All initiative tracker styles have been
 * reorganized into the following modules for better maintainability:
 *
 *   - initiative-layout.css   (Main tracker structure, headers, controls)
 *   - initiative-entities.css (Player/monster entity display)
 *   - initiative-controls.css (HP controls, buttons, inputs)
 *   - initiative-status.css   (Status indicators, consumables)
 *
 * These modules are imported in lib/styles/index.css.
 * Do NOT import this file directly; use the modular imports instead.
